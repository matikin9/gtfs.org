# GTFS: Making Public Transit Data Universally Accessible

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data specification that allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a [wide variety of software applications](/applications). Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers. 

Historically, TriMet worked with Google to format their transit data into an easily maintainable and consumable format that could be imported into Google Maps.


# Relation with MobilityData

gtfs.org is is maintained by MobilityData, a project which aims to the broaden adoption and increase the functionality of the GTFS data format. The MobilityData team includes a number of transportation thinkers and technical experts.
 
More information can be found at [https://mobilitydata.org/](ttps://mobilitydata.org/)

The MobilityData project is incubated by the [Rocky Mountain Institute](https://www.rmi.org/), an independent nonprofit that works to transform global energy use to create a clean, prosperous, and secure low-carbon future.
 
# Our Goal 

This website is meant help people to implement GTFS applications by providing answers to:
 - Non-technical persons who are looking to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GFTS file system
 - Developers looking for technical introduction to the GFTS
 - Developers looking for answers to specific technical issues
 - Developers intending to make specification change proposals

# [Specification](/specification/)

A GTFS feed, which contains static transit information, is composed of a number of text (.txt) files that are contained in a single ZIP file. 
Each file describes a particular aspect of transit information: stops, routes, trips, fares, etc. 

Consult this section if you are looking for information about static and realtime GTFS feeds.

# [Documentation](/documentation/)

This section includes a set of tutorials related to GTFS, guides, repositories of GTFS feeds, and examples of use of files.

Consult this section if you are looking for support related to the documentation.
# [Tools](/tools/)

Here, we explain the principles of a GTFS feed validator and provide links to several GTFS feed validators

# [About](/about/)


 
### gtfs.org in details
 
GTFS is split into a [static component](/reference/static/) that contains schedule, fare, and geographic transit information and a [real-time component](reference/realtime/v2) that contains arrival predictions, vehicle positions and service advisories.

The specification is detailed in the section ["Documentation"] (/documentation/).

[Examples of datasets](/datasets/) as well as [tutorials and tools](/guides/) are available on this website.  

Also, since GTFS is a community driven data format, online support is available. There exist GitHub issues, group chats and slack channels that are made to ease exchange of opinions on the GTFS matter by users.
It is also possible to  vote on changes to GTFS on these groups.
 
 [Follow this link](/guides/#support) for more details.
